## Projects

### Automated Job Board Checker
**Description**: This project automates the process of checking job postings on a job board. It ensures that job postings are still active, classifies job titles accurately, and matches locations effectively.
- **Features**:
  - Increases job classification accuracy from 80% to 95%+
  - Enhances location matching accuracy from 80% to 95%+
  - Saves significant time and costs on manual job posting checks
- **Video Walkthrough**: [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddt3pWnwXcs)
- **GitHub Repository**: [View Code](https://github.com/cmannion-meander/video-demos/blob/main/qa_bot.py)

### Other Projects
**Description**: Explore other AI engineering projects that demonstrate various applications of AI in different domains.
